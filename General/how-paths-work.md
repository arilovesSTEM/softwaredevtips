# How do paths work, anyway?

you'll use paths a lot in software development for referencing other files, which i'm told is- *checks notes* -very important if you want to use other files!

computers can read two different kinds of paths: **relative** and **absolute**. let's check the differences and see how they work!

# absolute paths

absolute paths are typically the most straight-forward, however very susceptible to breaking if your file structure isn't identical across systems! here's an example of an absolute path, pointing to the minecraft folder on my PC:

```
C:\Users\ari\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft
```

if you're on windows, you can see something similar by clicking the address bar in file explorer while inside a folder! (though windows likes to obfuscate some of the details, frustratingly.)

## pros
- you always know exactly where the file or directory you're pointing to is!
## cons
- if you move your project (or for example, .minecraft) to another directory, the whole path structure breaks! 

# relative paths

relative paths also pretty straight-forward, but require that you understand the context of where your file is located. some software (including `express` routes, which we'll cover in an example soon) even changes this context without immediately telling you! this can be very confusing. let's unpack!\

### current directory

```
./helloworld.txt
```

this path is very simple. `./` means "current directory", so typically wherever the directory of execution is! if i `cd` into that minecraft directory from earlier in my command line, i can then `cd` into `./saves/` to check out my saved worlds!

### parent directory

```
../another_directory/
```

while the prefix is similar, `../` actually means the "parent directory". if i `cd` to `../` from my minecraft directory, i would end up in the `Roaming` directory! doing it again would take me to `AppData`, then `ari`, and so on! you can even chain these together to traverse up multiple parent directories! (i.e. `../../../`)


# relative paths in express

this guide came to be after many expressed difficulty in understanding how relative imports worked in `express`, so it makes sense to address that here!

let's take this example project structure, modified from a template generated by `express-generator`:

```
/public
	/img
		favicon.png
		spaghetti.png
	/style
		main.css
	/js
		main.js
/views
	index.html
	shop.html
	checkout.html
	checkout-success.html
/routes
	index.js
	shop.js
app.js
package.json
```

here's an example of an error you might be inclined to include in your code:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>hello world!</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<img src="../public/img/spaghetti.png" alt="plate of spaghetti">
	</body>
</html>
```

as `index.html` is stored in `/views`, you'd be inclined to believe that to get `spaghetti.png`, we'd want to back up into the parent directory (our project root), enter `public`, then `img`, and *then* finally reach our lovely plate of spaghetti. while this may work if you simply open `index.html` in your browser, the web server handles this very differently!

in the above example, `index.html` is trying to access the parent directory to `/`, which is impossible! the user cannot have their spaghetti. the user weeps, pasta-less.

`express-generator`, by default, mounts the `/public` directory to `/` on our web server. we can take advantage of this in `index.html`, by simply changing the `src` of our image:

```html
<img src="/img/spaghetti.png" alt="plate of spaghetti">
```

the user can now have their spaghetti! the user rejoices, full of pasta.

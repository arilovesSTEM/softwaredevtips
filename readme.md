howdy n'yall! ðŸ‘‹

in lieu of the many, sometimes very wordy tips and pointers i've been giving to people since the semester started, i figure it'd be nice to consolidate all of these notes into a public repository for all to use!

i've written all of these mini-guides in markdown (.md) format, a highly-readable (and more importantly, highly-compatible) text format which works in all text editors! (i highly recommend [obsidian](https://obsidian.md). it's what i've used to write all of this, and it's an incredible little notes app!)

if you wish to keep this repo on your own device, simply run `git clone https://github.com/arilovesSTEM/softwaredevtips` into the directory of your choice! you can run `git pull` at any time to update your local copy with any changes made here.

if you would like to contribute to this resource, simply let me know or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/arilovesSTEM/softwaredevtips/pulls). your contributions are greatly appreciated!

hope you find this helpful! ðŸ’•
